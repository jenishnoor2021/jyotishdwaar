        <h2>Astrology</h2>
        <p>
            Astrology is a time-honored science that explores the connection between celestial movements and human life. It is based on the belief that the positions and motions of planets, stars, and other celestial bodies influence our personality traits, behaviors, and life events. Vedic astrology involves analyzing these planetary alignments at the time of a person's birth to offer deep insights into different aspects of life, such as relationships, career, health, and spiritual growth.
