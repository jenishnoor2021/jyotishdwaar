                    <h2>Vastu</h2>
                    <p>
                        Are living in an era where everyone toils hard all day to earn a roof over their heads. People
                        live in multi-story buildings where every apartment is built in a different direction. An
                        important question that arises in such a situation is – how to live peacefully in a house that
                        is not at all Vastu-compliant? In a world where the price of properties is touching the sky, is
                        it possible for a person to buy a Vastu-compliant home?
                    </p>
                    <p>According to Vastu, a home is a ‘living thing’ that is either full of energies or is lacking one.
                        We make a lot of efforts to enhance the energy of our body but fail to enrich the energies of
                        the surrounding of which we all are a part. There is a co-relation between the energy of a
                        person and the energy of a house. We often consider a house unlucky if we experience financial,
                        health or relationship problems while living in it.</p>

                    <p><strong>How to balance the energies of a house?</strong> Do not worry if your house is not Vastu
                        compliant. Follow the below steps to balance out any imbalance in the energies of the house:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>De-clutter your house – </strong> It is impossible to solve a problem if we do not
                            know the cause of it. First of all, it is important that you must identify the space that is
                            spreading negativity in your house. Look out for all the dirty,
                            dark and heavily loaded areas. De-clutter the spaces as positive energies only walk into the
                            homes that are clean and beautiful. Keep your house the way you keep yourself.</li>
                        <li><strong>Choose the right colors – </strong> Do you know that problems come up in a house if
                            there is too much use of a color or if there is a deficiency of it in the house? Check the
                            presence of rainbow colors – VIBGYOR. In Vastu Shastra, every direction
                            has a corresponding color. If one applies the colors appropriately, the positive energies
                            get enhanced. For example –</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Let air and light enter in the house – </strong> Air and Sun are necessary and
                            naturals energies. It is important that a house must be well-lit and well-ventilated. Light
                            coloured curtains must be used in the house. Always open the windows
                            in the morning, so that the sunlight can touch every corner of the house.</li>
                        <li><strong>Perform Yagya – </strong> Yagyas hold a lot of importance in Hinduism as they make
                            the environment of a house pious. If you feel that there are negative vibes in the house,
                            then perform a Yagya so that any form of unwanted energy can be removed
                            from the house. Also, light a lamp during the evening in the house. This protects a house
                            from the evil eyes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Meditate and balance your Chakras – </strong> Our body has seven main chakras that
                            can be balanced through meditation, pranayama, mantra chanting and therapies. Problems
                            related to health and mind can be cured if the chakras of the human are
                            balanced.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>No matter how big or small any house is, it is always possible to make it Vastu-compliant. The
                        negative effect of any ‘Vastu dosh’ can be nullified if a person maintains a healthy environment
                        in the house.</p>
