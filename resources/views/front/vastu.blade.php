        <h2>Vastu</h2>
        <p>
            We live in a time where people work tirelessly just to secure a home. In modern multi-storey buildings, apartments often face different directions. This raises an important question: how can one live peacefully in a home that doesn’t comply with Vastu principles? With soaring property prices, is it even possible to afford a Vastu-compliant house?
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Vastu Shastra, a home is a living entity filled with energies — or lacking them. While we focus a lot on boosting our personal energy, we often neglect the energy of the spaces we inhabit. There’s a deep connection between the energy of an individual and their home. We tend to label a house as “unlucky” when we face issues related to health, finance, or relationships while living there.

        <p><strong>How to balance the energies of your home?</strong> Don’t worry if your home isn’t Vastu-compliant. You can restore balance by following these simple steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Declutter your space –</strong> You can’t resolve a problem without identifying its source. Start by locating areas that feel heavy, dark, or disorganized — these often block positive energy. Clean, well-maintained homes are more likely to attract positive vibrations. Treat your house with the same care as your own body.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the right colors –</strong> An imbalance or overuse of certain colors can cause disturbances. Each direction in Vastu corresponds to a specific color. Incorporating the VIBGYOR color palette thoughtfully can improve energy flow. For example:</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Let air and light in –</strong> Natural elements like sunlight and fresh air are vital energy sources. Keep your home well-lit and ventilated. Use light-colored curtains and open windows each morning to let sunlight reach every corner.</li>
            <li><strong>Perform Yagya –</strong> Yagyas are sacred rituals in Hinduism known to purify the environment. If your home feels heavy or negative, a Yagya can cleanse the space. Lighting a lamp each evening also helps protect against negative energies.</li>
            <li><strong>Meditate and balance your Chakras –</strong> The human body has seven main chakras that govern our well-being. Regular meditation, pranayama, and mantra chanting can align these chakras and bring balance to your health and mind.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            No matter the size of your home, it can be transformed into a Vastu-friendly space. With mindful living and a balanced environment, the effects of any Vastu Dosh can be neutralized.
